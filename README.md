# Cheap Yellow Display Video Player (ESP32-2432S028)
## Instructions for Kiwi's screens
### Uploading new software/firmware to the board
1. Install Arduino IDE https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/
2. In the Arduino IDE settings, configure "Additional boards manager URLs" with `https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json`. 
3. In the Arduino IDE Board manager, add the board "esp32 by Espressif Systems".
4. In the Arduino IDE Library manager, add "GFX Library for Arduino" and "JPEGDEC".
5. In the Arduino IDE Sketch menu, choose "Include Library..." --> "Add ZIP library". Select "TFT_Touch_v0.3.zip"" from this root folder.
6. In the Arduino IDE Tools menu, select the board "ESP32 Dev Module" and upload speed 115200.

You can now modify "esp32-2432S028_video_player.ino" in the Arduino IDE and upload it to the board.

### Add videos
1. Get the videos from youtube, using yt-dlp: `brew install yt-dlp`.
2. Download a video: `yt-dlp -o myvideo.mp4 --merge-output-format mp4 -f "bv*" https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=6jVHREdafT8`
3. Use ffmpeg to convert the video into mjpeg format. There are a bunch of different parameters you can use to tweak the format to fit the tiny screen, here's an example: 
```
ffmpeg -y -i myvideo.mp4 -pix_fmt yuvj420p -q:v 2 -vf "transpose=1,fps=14,scale=240:320:flags=lanczos" myvideo.mjpeg
```
Unfortunately, VLC wont play these mjpeg files. You can however put it in an .avi container and play it: `ffmpeg -i myvideo.mjpeg -c:v copy myvideo.avi`

#### Add to the SD card
1. Remove the micro SD card from the board. You don't need to power down when doing this.
2. Using a SD card reader, you can add video files to the /mjpeg folder. The files need to be in the /mjpeg folder.
3. Reinsert the SD card in the board.

>⚠️ Make sure you have the board model ESP32-2432S028 with the **ILI9341 Display controller** — not the ST7789 (parallel) controller, which isn't supported by the graphic library [GFX Library for Arduino](https://github.com/moononournation/Arduino_GFX)

## Notes
> Some model of Cheap Yellow Display works only at speed of 40Mhz, change the DISPLAY_SPI_SPEED to 40000000L:
```cmd
#define DISPLAY_SPI_SPEED 40000000L // 40MHz 
```

⚠️ One of Kiwi's boards needs this. You can tell if you have this lemon board because the screen is scrambled on the normal 80Mhz setting. 

## 🎬 How to Use These FFmpeg Commands

Each of the following commands generates a `.mjpeg` file — a Motion JPEG video format — from an input `.mp4` or `.mov` video, optimized for use in frame-by-frame playback with an SD card reader.

Make sure you have [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed and accessible from your terminal or command prompt.

## Convert video of 16:9 (horizontal) to aspect ratio to 4:3
```cmd
ffmpeg -y -i input.mp4 -pix_fmt yuvj420p -q:v 7 -vf "transpose=1,fps=24,scale=-1:320:flags=lanczos" output.mjpeg
```

## Convert video of 9:16 (vertical) to aspect ratio to 3:4
```cmd
ffmpeg -y -i input.mp4 -pix_fmt yuvj420p -q:v 7 -vf "fps=24,scale=-1:320:flags=lanczos" output.mjpeg
```
## Command for a horizontal video already of aspect ratio 4:3
```cmd
ffmpeg -y -i cropped_4x3.mp4 -pix_fmt yuvj420p -q:v 7 -vf "transpose=1,fps=24,scale=240:320:flags=lanczos" final_240x320.mjpeg
```

## Command for a vertical video already of aspect ratio 3:4
```cmd
ffmpeg -y -i cropped.mp4 -pix_fmt yuvj420p -q:v 7 -vf "fps=24,scale=240:320:flags=lanczos" scaled.mjpeg
```

## Example To reduce brightness of the output video (helps with bright colors)
see [issue 7](https://github.com/thelastoutpostworkshop/esp32-2432S028_video_player/issues/7)
```cmd
ffmpeg -y -i "input.mp4" -q:v 6 -filter:v "scale=-1:ih/2,eq=brightness=-0.05" -c:v mjpeg -an "output.mjpeg"
```

### Options explained
- -pix_fmt yuvj420p: Ensures JPEG-compatible pixel format
- -q:v 7: Controls image quality (lower is better; 1 = best, 31 = worst)
- -vf: Specifies the video filters:
- fps=24: Extracts 24 frames per second
- scale: Resizes the video
- transpose=1: Rotates the video 90° clockwise
- eq: Applies an equalizer filter to slightly darken the video. Values range from -1.0 to 1.0.
- .mjpeg: Output format used when streaming or storing a series of JPEG frames as a video
